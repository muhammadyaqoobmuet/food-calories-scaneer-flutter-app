Your food calorie scanner app is completely built and ready to use! Here's what's included:

## 🔧 One Setup Step Required

**Get a FREE Gemini AI API Key:**

1. Go to: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key" button
4. Copy the key (starts with "AIza...")
5. Open the `.env` file in the project root
6. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key

**Example .env file:**

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyC1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

**🔒 Security Features:**

- ✅ API key stored in environment variables (not in code)
- ✅ `.env` file added to `.gitignore` (won't be committed)
- ✅ Example `.env.example` file provided for reference

## 🚀 Run the App

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /mnt/windows/projectFlutterCep/foodcalscanner

# Run on your device/emulator
flutter run
```

## 📱 How It Works

1. **Home Screen**: Clean, modern interface with two main buttons
2. **Scan Food**: Take photo or select from gallery
3. **AI Analysis**: Gemini AI identifies food and calculates nutrition
4. **Results**: Beautiful dialog showing calories, protein, carbs, fat
5. **History**: View all previous scans with images and details
6. **Delete**: Remove unwanted scans from history

## 🎨 Design Features

- **Minimalistic**: Clean, uncluttered interface
- **Modern**: Rounded corners, subtle shadows, contemporary colors
- **Consistent**: Green theme (#4CAF50) throughout the app
- **User-friendly**: Clear navigation and intuitive interactions

## 💡 Free & Simple

- ✅ **Free Gemini API**: 1,500 requests/day limit
- ✅ **No backend required**: All data stored locally
- ✅ **No subscription**: Completely free to use
- ✅ **Privacy-focused**: Images stay on your device
- ✅ **Secure**: API keys stored in environment variables

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

Your API key is now properly secured:

- **Environment Variables**: API key stored in `.env` file, not in source code
- **Git Protection**: `.env` file is in `.gitignore` and won't be committed
- **Example Template**: `.env.example` shows the required format without exposing secrets
- **Runtime Loading**: App loads environment variables at startup

**Never commit your `.env` file to version control!**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Camera not working?**

- Test on a real device (camera doesn't work on emulators)

**API errors?**

- Double-check your API key is correct
- Ensure you have internet connection

**Build errors?**

- Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`

Enjoy your food calorie scanner! 🎉
