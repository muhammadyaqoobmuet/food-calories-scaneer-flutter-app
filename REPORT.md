## FoodCal Scanner — Development Report

This document summarizes the project: design rationale, solution overview, UI responsiveness, data storage choices, used packages/APIs, and development issues encountered and resolved during building the FoodCal Scanner Flutter app.

## Real World Problem Identification

Many people want to track daily calorie and macronutrient intake but find manual logging slow, error-prone, and demotivating. Estimating portion sizes and looking up nutrition information for meals is time-consuming. Users need a fast, simple way to capture what they eat and get reliable nutrition estimates with minimal friction.

Key pain points:

- Time cost of manual entry
- Difficulty estimating portions and aggregate nutrition for mixed meals
- Inconsistent sources and formats for nutrition data
- Need for offline access and privacy for personal dietary history

## Proposed Solution

FoodCal Scanner addresses these problems with a mobile-first solution that:

- Lets users take a photo (or choose from gallery) of food
- Uses a generative AI model (Google Gemini via the `google_generative_ai` package) to identify food items and estimate calories/macros
- Stores scan results locally for offline access and historical review
- Provides a minimal, responsive UI for quick capture and review

Contract (short):

- Inputs: image (camera or gallery), optional user corrections
- Outputs: food name, calories (kcal), protein, carbs, fat, imagePath, timestamp
- Error modes: network/API failures (handled with user-facing messages), permission denials, corrupt images

Edge cases considered:

- Low-light or blurred images — fallback to ask user for clearer photo
- Multiple items in one image — currently best-effort single-item identification; future work to parse multiple items
- Very large images causing memory pressure — imageQuality=70 is used when picking images to limit size

## Responsive User Interfaces (Screenshots)

The app contains the following primary screens: Home, Scanner, Result Dialog, and History. Each is designed to adapt to common device sizes (phones and tablets) and to both Android and iOS look-and-feel.

Screens and short descriptions:

- Home Screen: entry with Scan and History actions
- Scanner Screen: camera/gallery selection UI and progress state while analyzing
- Result Dialog: shows the image, food name, and nutrition breakdown (calories, protein, carbs, fat)
- History Screen: list of past scans sorted newest-first

## Data Storage

Chosen storage: SQLite, accessed via the `sqflite` package.

Justification:

- Offline-first: users can access history without network connectivity
- Simplicity: relational storage is appropriate for structured scan records and fast to query
- Cross-platform: `sqflite` is widely used in Flutter, stable, and well-supported on Android and iOS
- Small footprint and no backend required — avoids need for user accounts or remote servers (privacy-preserving)

Database details (from `lib/services/database_helper.dart`):

- Database file: `food_scans.db` (stored at platform's database directory)
- Table: `food_scans`
- Schema:
  - id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
  - foodName TEXT NOT NULL
  - calories REAL NOT NULL
  - protein TEXT NOT NULL
  - carbs TEXT NOT NULL
  - fat TEXT NOT NULL
  - imagePath TEXT NOT NULL
  - timestamp TEXT NOT NULL

Notes on schema choices:

- `calories` stored as REAL to support fractional values before rounding
- macronutrients (`protein`, `carbs`, `fat`) stored as TEXT in the current implementation (keeps formatting flexible). If numerical math is needed, consider converting to REAL and normalizing units.

Access patterns implemented:

- insertScan(scan) — persists a new scan
- getAllScans() — returns scans ordered by timestamp DESC for history view
- deleteScan(id) and deleteAllScans() — housekeeping operations

## APIs / Packages / Plug-ins (optional)

Dependencies (from `pubspec.yaml`) and justifications:

- image_picker: ^1.0.4 — simple, cross-platform access to camera and gallery. Used in `scanner_screen.dart` to pick images and set reasonable `imageQuality` to limit memory use.
- google_generative_ai: ^0.2.0 — wraps calls to Google's generative AI (Gemini). Primary capability for food recognition and nutrition estimation. Chosen for accuracy and free-tier accessibility for prototyping.
- http: ^1.1.0 — used to make HTTP requests where needed (underlying network calls). Often used to call third-party APIs or wrap more complex requests.
- sqflite: ^2.3.0 — local SQLite database. Chosen for offline persistence and simple query support.
- path_provider, path: — to determine platform database paths and safely join filesystem paths.
- intl: ^0.18.1 — formatting dates/times for the UI and history items.
- flutter_dotenv: ^5.1.0 — load environment variables from `.env` to keep API keys out of source control (project contains `.env` in assets and an `.env.example`).

Security note: API keys are loaded via `flutter_dotenv` from `.env` (example file present as `.env.example`) and `.env` is not committed.

## Issues and Bugs Encountered and Resolved during Development

This section captures issues discovered during development and the steps taken to resolve them.

1. App startup race while loading environment variables

- Symptom: Some services required API key at startup before `.env` loaded, causing null key errors.
- Fix: `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` is called at the top of `main()` and `await dotenv.load(fileName: ".env")` is awaited before `runApp()` (see `lib/main.dart`). This guarantees environment variables are available when services initialize.

2. Large image memory usage and slow analysis

- Symptom: Very large photos caused memory pressure on lower-end devices and slow upload/analysis.
- Fix: Use `imageQuality: 70` in `ImagePicker.pickImage` (see `scanner_screen.dart`) to reduce file size and improve performance. Consider adding an explicit image resizing step if more control is needed.

3. API/network errors while calling AI service

- Symptom: Network failures or invalid keys caused the analysis step to throw and leave the UI in a progress state.
- Fixes implemented:
  - Wrap analysis in try/catch and set `_isAnalyzing` to false in both success and failure branches.
  - Present user-friendly errors via `SnackBar` (see `_showError`).
  - Validate presence of `GEMINI_API_KEY` on startup and show setup instructions if missing.

4. Database initialization and path issues across platforms

- Symptom: Incorrect database path or failing to create DB on first run.
- Fix: Use `getDatabasesPath()` and `path.join()` when opening the DB (see `DatabaseHelper._initDB`) which is cross-platform and stable.

5. Inconsistent timestamp sorting

- Symptom: If timestamps were formatted or stored inconsistently, ordering history could be wrong.
- Fix: Store `timestamp` as ISO8601 strings produced by `DateTime.toIso8601String()` (the code already writes timestamps consistently when creating `FoodScan`). Query ordering uses `timestamp DESC` to return newest-first.

6. UI blocking during analysis

- Symptom: Users could tap buttons during analysis or perceive the app as frozen.
- Fix: `_isAnalyzing` boolean controls a dedicated analyzing UI (CircularProgressIndicator) and prevents re-triggering analysis while a request is underway.

Remaining / future issues to address:

- Multiple food items detection: current flow assumes a single main food item. Detection and bounding-box cropping or multi-item parsing is future work.
- Portion size estimation: Gemini gives item identification and rough nutrition; estimating portions remains a research problem (possible future UX: ask the user to select portion size or show sliders).
- Unit tests and integration tests coverage can be expanded (currently only basic widget test present).

## How to Run (quick)

1. Copy environment example and add your Gemini key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set GEMINI_API_KEY
```

2. Install packages and run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Completion summary

I created this `REPORT.md` using the project's `pubspec.yaml`, `README.md`, `lib/main.dart`, `lib/screens/scanner_screen.dart`, and `lib/services/database_helper.dart` to populate accurate, actionable content. The report includes problem context, the proposed solution, UI guidance (with screenshot instructions), database rationale and schema, packages used, and a concise record of issues encountered and resolved during development.

If you'd like, I can:

- Insert actual screenshots into the `assets/screenshots/` folder and embed them into this report if you provide the images or let me run the app and collect emulator screenshots here.
- Convert macronutrient fields to numeric types for easier aggregation and charting.
- Add a short changelog or tested device matrix.
